# Windows ClickLock Notification
A small application that notifies the user when Windows ClickLock is Active.

The script was made to use with Autohotkey software (GPL https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/license.htm)

Or as a standalone EXE file compiled by AHK2EXE.

The application uses less than 3 Mb of RAM and very few CPU cycles.

=======================================================================


**The Problem:** ClickLock in Windows 10 Mouse Settings does not have any notification when active.

ClickLock sometimes makes sense with TouchPad. However, I have never used this feature with a standard mouse.


**The Solution:** Start an internal counter and beep + show a small tooltip near the mouse cursor when ~5s is passed.

Notes:

    - ClickLock duration is 4.5s
    
    - Beep tone and duration are predefined
    
    - Tooltip is Unicode â•³ symbol
