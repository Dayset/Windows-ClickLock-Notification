# Windows ClickLock Notification
Small application that notifies user when Windows ClickLock is Active.

Script was made to use with Autohotkey software (GPL https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/license.htm)

Or as standalone EXE file compilled by AHK2EXE.

Application uses less than 3mb of RAM memory and very few CPU cycles.

============================================================================================


**The Problem:** ClickLock in Windows 10 Mouse Settings do not have any notification when it is active.

ClickLock is sometimes makes sense with TouchPad. I have never used this feature with normal mouse.


**The Solution:** Start an internal counter and beep + show small tooltip near the mouse cursor at ~5s mark.
